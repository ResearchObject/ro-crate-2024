The LDaCA Program architecture consists of a set of modular services; data preservation/archiving, APIs for delivery, access control and a discovery portal for data and analysis tools as well as automated container-based notebook environments to run analytics via the Australian Text Analytics Platform (which is a component of the broader program).

The [data portal](https://data.atap.edu.au/) for the ATAP platform is the first released product, there will be more data portals which provide access to a broader range of data in 2023.

---------------------------------------------------------------

RO-Crate is the central metadata standard for all data within the LDaCA environment.

### [](#archiving)Archiving

RO-Crate provides a consistent metadata model for long term archiving and preservation and is used to store archival copies of language datasets using the [Oxford Common File Layout](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/standards/ocfl/).

### [](#api-access)API Access

The LDaCA project provide access-controlled API access to data using the [Oni](https://github.com/Arkisto-Platform/oni) tool. Access control is important for language data as it is created by and collected from humans who have intellectual property rights over the data and some of he content may be confidential

For example, this query looks for RO-Crates which package objects, with a conformsTo property from the (draft) profile: [https://purl.archive.org/textcommons/profile#Collection](https://purl.archive.org/textcommons/profile#Collection)

```
     curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:9000/api/object?conformsTo=https://purl.archive.org/textcommons/profile%23Collection' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX'
```    

In this demonstration this returns 10 results (truncated here), which can then be fetched using the crateId property.
```

### [](#discovery-portals)Discovery portals

The structural API described above is used to build discovery and access portals which use the metadata from RO-Crate objects to generate an Elasticsearch index and a web site to search and browse the RO-Crate-packaged data.

The portal/index system us highly configurable to work with differently structured RO-Crate data.
