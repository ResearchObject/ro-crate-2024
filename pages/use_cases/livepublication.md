# LivePublication: Executable Paper

[LivePublication](https://livepublication.github.io/LP_Pub_LID/) is a proof of concept of an _executable paper_, which interactive visualization and statistical calculations can be regenerated on the fly taking into consideration data sources updated after the paper's publication date. 

A [corresponding RO-Crate](https://livepublication.github.io/LP_Pub_OrchestrationCrate/) is the mechanism to enable this execution on the Globus infrastructure through an innovative use of individual RO-Crates and containers for each computable element of the paper, nested within a top-level Crate for the paper.

This novel approach shows how it is possible to use RO-Crate as an machine-actionable object, which do not rely on bundling an underlying workflow representation in an existing workflow language.

executablepaper also plans to do...

executablepaper:
