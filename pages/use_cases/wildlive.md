# Senckenberg Wildlive data portal

Senckenberg's [Wildlive data portal](https://wildlive.senckenberg.de/), is a repository and analysis platform for biodiversity monitoring. 

Using [FAIR Signposting](https://signposting.org/FAIR/), the images from cameras monitoring wildlife are also navigatable as FAIR Digital Objects using RO-Crate to expose the  metadata. 

The portal uses [detached RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.2-DRAFT/structure.html#detached-ro-crate) as the images are served over separate API calls for seaprate digital objects. At the same time, the use of Handles for persistent identifiers have been explored, as a demonstrator of a hybrid Web/Handle FDO based on the .
