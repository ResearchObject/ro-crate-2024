# Modern PARADISEC

[Modern PARADISEC](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/case-studies/paradisec/) demonstrates the use of RO-Crate to describe the collections and items. The demonstrator includes an elastic search service and a webserver but the key feature is that it keeps working with only the filesystem and a webserver.
