# UTS Research Data Repository

The [UTS Research Data Repository](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/case-studies/uts-repo/) is a searchable portal for discovering and accessing public datasets by UTS researchers. Datasets are described with RO-Crates and published either through the Universityâ€™s institutional research data management system or direct import from research storage devices for very large datasets.
