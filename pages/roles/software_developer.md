title: Sofware Developer
description: Software developers develop software systems, and this is their day-to-day work. They may not necessarily be involved in the design, nor in ongoing maintenance. Software engineers will also be involved in the design, and possibly less in the implementation. Research software engineers would be involved in all stages, and likely subsequent maintenance. RO-crates may provide a solution for integration/archiving/distribution in various development steps.
