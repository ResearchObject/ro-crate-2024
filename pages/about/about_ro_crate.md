## What is an RO-Crate?

An RO-Crate is a [Research Object](background#research-object-background) (or _RO_) formed of a collection of data (a _crate_) and a special `ro-crate-metadata.json` file which describes the collection.

The collection may contain any kind of research data - papers, data files, software, references to other research, and so on. It may be a folder full of files, an abstract grouping of connected references, or a combination of both.

The `ro-crate-metadata.json` file (also known as the _RO-Crate Metadata Document_) is a plain text file, readable by humans and machines, that includes metadata for each item within the collection - the authors, license, identifier, provenance, and so on. Any folder can be turned into an RO-Crate by adding an `ro-crate-metadata.json` file.

Researchers can distribute their work as an RO-Crate to ensure their data travels with its metadata, so that key components are correctly tracked, archived, and attributed.

RO-Crate uses the [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org) format, which is based on [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). The `ro-crate-metadata.json` file can be written by hand or by using one of the existing [tools](tools). Some workflow managers (such as Galaxy) support exporting RO-Crates from their web interface.

Below is an example of an `ro-crate-metadata.json` file, which describes rainfall data published by an Australian institute under a Creative Commons license:

## Why should I use RO-Crate?

When someone else uses your data in their research, it's important for them to know where the data came from and how they should cite it. Using RO-Crate helps users of your data answer questions like:

* when and how was this data collected/generated?
* who should be cited as authors for this dataset?
* how do the different files in the dataset relate to each other?

A number of platforms currently support importing and/or exporting RO-Crates (see [Use Cases](use_cases)), and interoperability continues to grow thanks to the thriving [RO-Crate community](community).

## Who is RO-Crate for?

RO-Crate is for both producers and consumers of data. The RO-Crate community effort brings together practitioners from very different backgrounds, and with different motivations and use-cases. Among our core target users are:

* researchers engaged with computation and data-intensive, workflow-driven analysis
* digital repository managers and infrastructure providers
* individual researchers looking for a straight-forward tool or how-to guide to “FAIRify” their data
* data stewards supporting research projects in creating and curating datasets.

RO-Crates are suitable for any domain, as they are general-purpose and can contain arbitrary data, but they can also be specialised through the use of [RO-Crate Profiles](profiles). Profiles define additional conventions, types and properties that RO-Crates may use within a particular domain, application or framework. For example, the [Workflow RO-Crate profile](https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/) provides guidance on constructing RO-Crates that describe executable workflows.

We continue to gather [use cases](use_cases), please help us by adding more.

## About the RO-Crate Community

The [RO-Crate specification](specification) is developed openly on GitHub by research community members across the globe. RO-Crate [tools](tools) and [profiles](profiles) are also community-developed and open-source. 

Anyone can join the RO-Crate community and contribute to these outputs. See the [Community](community) pages for more information.
