- title: Sofware Developer
  description: >
    Software developers develop software systems, and this is their day-to-day work. 
    They may not necessarily be involved in the design, nor in ongoing maintenance. 
    Software engineers will also be involved in the design, and possibly less in the implementation. 
    Research software engineers would be involved in all stages, and likely subsequent maintenance. 
    RO-crates may provide a solution for integration/archiving/distribution in various development steps.

    or else ensuring outputs conform to those regulations. And profiles or schemas for consistency.

  description: >
    A manager will operate at a higher strategic level, and may not necessarily want the deep technical / implementation details around RO-crates. 
    A higher level view of RO-crates in a wider context is required.
