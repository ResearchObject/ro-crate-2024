# RO-Crate profiles
    
While RO-Crates can be considered general-purpose containers of arbitrary data and open-ended metadata, in practical use within a particular domain, application or framework, it will be beneficial to further constrain RO-Crate to a specific **profile**: a set of conventions, types and properties that one minimally can require and expect to be present in that subset of RO-Crates.

Defining and conforming to such a profile enables reliable programmatic consumption of an RO-Crate’s content, as well as consistent creation, e.g. a form in a user interface containing the required types and properties, and likewise a rendering of an RO-Crate can easier make rich UI components if it can reliably assume for instance that the [`Person`](contextual-entities.md#people) always has an `affiliation` to a [`Organization`](contextual-entities.md#organizations-as-values) which has a `url` - a restriction that may not be appropriate for all types of RO-Crates.

As such RO-Crate Profiles can be considered a _duck typing_ mechanism for RO-Crates, but also as a classifier to indicate the crate's purpose, expectations and focus.

## Publishing an RO-Crate profile

An _RO-Crate profile_ is identified with a **Profile URI**.

Recommendations:
* The profile URI MUST resolve to a human-readable _profile description_ (e.g. a HTML web page)
  - The profile URI MAY have a corresponding machine-readable [_Profile Crate_](#profile-crate)
* The profile URI SHOULD be a _permalink_ (persistent identifier)
  - e.g. starting with <https://w3id.org/> <http://purl.org/> or <https://doi.org/> 
* The profile URI SHOULD be _versioned_ with [`MAJOR.MINOR`][semver], e.g. `http://example.com/image-profile-2.4`
* The profile description SHOULD use key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL as described in [RFC 2119].

Suggestions:
* The profile MAY require/suggest which `@type` of [data entities](data-entities) and/or [contextual entities](contextual-entities) are expected.
* The profile MAY require/suggest _properties_ expected per type of entity (e.g. _"Each [CreativeWork] must declare a [license]"_)
* The profile MAY require/suggest a particular [version of RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification.html).
* The profile MAY recommend [RO-Crate extensions](appendix/jsonld.md#extending-ro-crate) with domain-specific terms and vocabularies.
* The profile MAY require/suggest a particular [JSON-LD context](appendix/jsonld.md?highlight=@context#ro-crate-json-ld-context).
* The profile MAY require/suggest a particular RO-Crate publishing method or [packaging](appendix/implementation-notes.md#combining-with-other-packaging-schemes) like .zip or BagIt.


## Declaring conformance of an RO-Crate profile

RO-Crate can describe a profile by adding it as an [contextual entity](contextual-entities):

```json
{
    "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/process/0.1",
    "@type": ["CreativeWork", "Profile"],
    "name": "Process Run crate profile",
    "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

The contextual entity for a profile:

* The `@type` SHOULD be an array. The `@type` MUST include [Profile].
* The `'@type` SHOULD include `CreativeWork` (indicating a Web Page) or `Dataset` (indicating a Profile Crate).
* SHOULD have an absolute URI as `@id`
* SHOULD have a descriptive [name]
* MAY declare [version], preferably according to [Semantic Versioning][semver]

RO-Crates that are _conforming to_ (or intending to conform to) such a profile SHOULD declare this using `conformsTo` on the [root data entity](root-data-entity):

```json
{
    "@id": "./",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "conformsTo":
        {"@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/process/0.1"}       
}
```

It is valid for a crate to conform to multiple profiles, in which case `conformsTo` is an unordered array.

Note that as profile conformance is declared on the RO-Crate Root (`./` in this example), the profile applies to the whole RO-Crate, and may cover aspects beyond the crate's metadata file (e.g. identifiers, packaging, purpose).


## Profile Crate

While the Profile URI `@id` must resolve to a human-readable _profile description_, it can additionally be made to [resolve](#how-to-retrieve-a-profile-crate) to a _Profile Crate_.

A **Profile Crate** is a type of RO-Crate that gathers resources which further define the profile. This allows formalizing alternative profile description for machine-readability, for instance for validation, but also additional resources like examples.

The [Root Data entity](root-data-entity) of a Profile Crate MUST declare `Profile` as an additional `@type`:

```json
{
    "@id": "http://example.com/",
    "@type": ["Dataset", "Profile"],
    "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/process/0.1",
    "name": "Process Run crate profile",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "hasPart": [ ],
    "…": ""
}
```

The rest of the requirements for being referenced as a contextual entity also apply here:

* SHOULD have an absolute URI as `@id`
* SHOULD have a descriptive [name]
* MAY declare [version], preferably according to [Semantic Versioning][semver] (e.g. `0.4.0`)
* SHOULD list related data entities using `hasPart` (see [below](#what-is-included-in-the-profile-crate))

### How to retrieve a Profile Crate

To resolve a Profile URI to a machine-readable _Profile Crate_, two approaches are recommended to retrieve its [RO-Crate Metadata Document](root-data-entity.md#ro-crate-metadata-file-descriptor):

1. [HTTP Content-negotiation] for the [RO-Crate media type](appendix/jsonld.md#ro-crate-json-ld-media-type), for example:  

Requesting `https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/1.0` with HTTP header

  `Accept: application/ld+json;profile=https://w3id.org/ro/crate` redirects to the _RO-Crate Metadata file_
  `https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/1.0/ro-crate-metadata.json`

2. The above approach may fail (or returns a HTML page), e.g. for content-delivery networks that do not support content-negotiation. The fallback is to try resolving the path `./ro-crate-metadata.json` from the _resolved_ URI (after permalink redirects). For example:  
If permalink `https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/1.0` redirects to `https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/1.0/index.html` (a HTML page), then
try retrieving `https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/1.0/ro-crate-metadata.json`
3. If none of these approaches worked, then this profile probably does not have a corresponding Profile Crate. For humans, display a hyperlink to its `@id` described by its `name`.

<!-- TODO Make both examples above actually work! -->

### What is included in the Profile Crate? 

Below follows the suggested [data entities](data-entities) to include in a Profile Crate using `hasPart`. 

#### Declaring the role within the crate

In order for programmatic use of the Profile Crate to consume particular subresources, e.g. for validation, the _role_ of each entity SHOULD be declared by including them using `hasResource` to a `ResourceDescriptor` contextual entity that references the subresource using `hasResource`, as defined by the [Profiles Vocabulary]:

```json
{
    "@id": "http://example.com/my-crate-profile/0.1/",
    "@type": ["Dataset", "Profile"],
    "name": "My Crate Profile",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "hasPart": [
        {"@id": "http://example.com/my-crate-profile/0.1/shape.shex"}
    ],
    "hasResource": [
        {"@id": "#hasShape"}
    ]
}
{ 
    "@id": "#hasShape",
    "@type": "ResourceDescriptor",
    "hasRole": { "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/constraints" },
    "hasArtifact": {"@id": "http://example.com/my-crate-profile/0.1/shape.shex"}
}
```

The [`ResourceDescriptor`](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/#Class:ResourceDescriptor) entity MAY also declare `dct:format` or `dct:conformsTo`, however the data entity referenced with `hasArtifact` SHOULD declare `encodingFormat` (with OPTIONAL `conformsTo`) to specify its [encoding format](data-entities#adding-detailed-descriptions-of-encodings), e.g.:

```json
{
    "@id": "http://example.com/my-crate-profile/0.1/shape.shex",
    "@type": "File",
    "encodingFormat": [
        "text/shex", 
        {"@id": "http://shex.io/shex-semantics/" }
    ]
}
```

The referenced role SHOULD be declared as a `DefinedTerm` contextual entity. 
The recommended [predefined roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/#resource-roles-vocab) from the Profiles Vocabulary are:

```json
{
    "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/constraints",
    "@type": ["DefinedTerm", "ResourceRole"],
    "name": "Constraints", 
    "description": "Descriptions of obligations, limitations or extensions that the profile defines"
},
{
    "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/example",
    "@type": ["DefinedTerm", "ResourceRole"],
    "name": "Example", 
    "description": "Sample instance data conforming to the profile"
},
{
    "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/guidance",
    "@type": ["DefinedTerm", "ResourceRole"],
    "name": "Guidance", 
    "description": "Documents, in human-readable form, how to use the profile"
},
{
    "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/mapping",
    "@type": ["DefinedTerm", "ResourceRole"],
    "name": "Mapping", 
    "description": "Describes conversions between two specifications"
},
{
    "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/schema",
    "@type": ["DefinedTerm", "ResourceRole"],
    "name": "Schema", 
    "description": "Machine-readable structural descriptions of data defined by the profile"
},
{
    "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/specification",
    "@type": ["DefinedTerm", "ResourceRole"],
    "name": "Specification", 
    "description": "Defining the profile in human-readable form"
},
{
    "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/validation",
    "@type": ["DefinedTerm", "ResourceRole"],
    "name": "Validation", 
    "description": "Supplies instructions about how to verify conformance of data to the profile"
},
{
    "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/vocabulary",
    "@type": ["DefinedTerm", "ResourceRole"],
    "name": "Vocabulary", 
    "description": "Defines terms used in the profile specification"
}
```

The examples in the rest of this document will list the data entities with a corresponding `ResourceDescriptor` entity, but for brevity not repeating the required `hasPart` `hasArtifact` and `DefinedTerm` declarations.

Below follows the suggested [data entities](data-entities) to include in a Profile Crate using `hasPart`:

#### Profile description entity

A Profile Crate MUST declare a human-readable _profile description_, which is [about] this Profile Crate and SHOULD have [encodingFormat] as `text/html`. The corresponding `ResourceDescriptor` SHOULD have identifier `http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/specification` or `http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/guidance` -- for example:

```json
{
    "@id": "index.html",
    "@type": "File",
    "name": "Workflow RO-Crate profile description",
    "encodingFormat": "text/html",
    "about": "./",
},
{ 
    "@id": "#hasSpecification",
    "@type": "ResourceDescriptor",
    "hasRole": { "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/specification" },
    "hasArtifact": {"@id": "index.html"},
    "about": "./"
}
```

The _profile description_ MAY be equivalent to the
[RO-Crate Website](structure.md#ro-crate-website-ro-crate-previewhtml-and-ro-crate-preview_files) entity
`ro-crate-preview.html` (becoming a data entity by listing it under `hasPart`):

```json
{
    "@id": "ro-crate-preview.html",
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name": "RO-Crate preview of the Process Run Crate",
    "encodingFormat": "text/html",
    "about": "./"
}
```


#### Profile Schema entity


An optional machine-readable _schema_ of the profile, for instance a [Describo JSON profile]:

```json
{
    "@id": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UTS-eResearch/describo/v0.13.0/src/components/profiles/paradisec.describo.profile.json",
    "@type": "File",
    "name": "PARADISEC profile for Describo",
    "encodingFormat": "application/json",
    "conformsTo": {"@id": "https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/describo/wiki/dsp-index#profile-structure"}
},
{ 
    "@id": "#hasSchema",
    "@type": "ResourceDescriptor",
    "hasRole": { "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/schema" },
    "hasArtifact": {"@id": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UTS-eResearch/describo/v0.13.0/src/components/profiles/paradisec.describo.profile.json"}
},
{
    "@id": "https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/describo/wiki/dsp-index#profile-structure",
    "@type": "Profile",
    "name": "Describo JSON profile"
}
```

A schema may formalize restrictions on the 
[RO-Crate Metadata Document](root-data-entity.md#ro-crate-metadata-file-descriptor) on 
a graph-level (e.g. what types/properties) as well as serialization level
(e.g. use of JSON arrays). 

This interpretation of _schema_ assumes the resource somewhat describes the data structure, e.g. expected types and attributes the RO-Crate's JSON-LD. Use alternatively the role `http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/validation` if the schema is primarily a set of constraint for validation purposes, or `http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/vocabulary` for ontologies and term listings.



Below are known schema types in their recommended media type, with suggested identifiers for the contextual entities of
[encodingFormat](data-entities.md#adding-detailed-descriptions-of-encodings) with type `Standard` and `conformsTo` with type `Profile`:

| Name           | `encodingFormat` Media Type   | `encodingFormat` URI   | `conformsTo` URI |  role  | 
| -------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| JSON Schema    | `application/schema+json` | <https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema> |  |  `schema` | 
| Describo       | `application/json`        | <https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt/817> | <https://github.com/describo/profiles> | `schema` |
| CheckMyCrate   | `application/json`        | <https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt/817> | <https://github.com/KockataEPich/CheckMyCrate#profiles> | `validation` |
| SHACL          | `text/turtle`             | <https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt/874> |  <https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/> | `validation` |
| ShExC          | `text/shex`               | <http://shex.io/shex-semantics/#shexc> |  |  `validation`
| ShExJ          | `application/ld+json`     | <https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt/880> | <http://shex.io/shex-semantics/#shexj> |  `validation` |
| BagIt Profile  | `application/json`        | <https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt/817>  | <https://bagit-profiles.github.io/bagit-profiles-specification/> | `schema`
| SKOS           | `text/turtle`             | <https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt/874> | <http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference> | `vocabulary`
| OWL 2 (in RDF) | `text/turtle`             | <https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt/874> | <http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-mapping-to-rdf/>  | `vocabulary` |

{: .tip }
Some of the above schema languages are based on general data structure syntaxes 
like `application/json` and `text/turtle`, and therefore have a 
generic  `encodingFormat` with a specialized `conformsTo` _URI_, which itself is declared as a `Profile`.



#### Software that works with the profile

[Software](provenance.md#software-used-to-create-files) that may consume/validate/generate RO-Crates following this profile (potentially using the schema):

```json
{
      "@id": "https://arkisto-platform.github.io/describo/",
      "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
      "name": "Describo",
      "version": "0.13.0",
      "url": "https://arkisto-platform.github.io/describo/"
}
```

#### Repositories that expect the profile

A [repository](provenance.md#digital-library-and-repository-content) or collection within a repository that may accept/contain RO-Crates following this profile:

```json
{
   "@id": "https://mod.paradisec.org.au/",
   "@type": "RepositoryCollection",
   "title":  "Modern PARADISEC demonstrator",   
   "description": "PARADISEC curates digital material about small or endangered languages",
   "publisher": {"@id": "https://paradisec.org.au/"}
}
```

#### BagIt packaging

If conforming RO-Crates should be [packaged](appendix/implementation-notes.md#adding-ro-crate-to-bagit) according to a [BagIt profile] (e.g. must be serialized as an `application/zip`):

```json
{
   "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/bagit/profile/0.3",
   "@type": "WebPage",
   "name":  "BagIt profile for RO-Crate in ZIP",
   "encodingFormat": [
        "application/json", 
        {"@id": "https://bagit-profiles.github.io/bagit-profiles-specification/"}
   ]   
}
```

<!-- TODO: Make BagIt profile similar to https://w3id.org/ro/bagit -->

#### Extension vocabularies

A profile that [extends RO-Crate](appendix/jsonld.md#extending-ro-crate) SHOULD indicate
which vocabulary/ontology it uses as a [DefinedTermSet]:

```json
{
    "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#",
    "@type": "DefinedTermSet",
    "name": "Namespace for workflow testing metadata",
    "url": "https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-terms/tree/master/test",
}
```

The `@id` of the vocabulary SHOULD be the _namespace_, 
while `url` SHOULD go to a human-readable description of the vocabulary.

A profile that defines many extensions term MAY define its own `DefinedTermSet` and relate the terms using `hasDefinedTerm`:

```json
 {
    "@id": "https://w3id.org/cpm/ro-crate",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "identifier": "https://w3id.org/cpm/ro-crate",
    "name": "Common Provenance Model RO-Crate profiles and vocabulary",
    "hasPart": [
      { "@id": "https://w3id.org/cpm/ro-crate#" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "@id": "https://w3id.org/cpm/ro-crate#",
    "@type": "DefinedTermSet",
    "name": "Namespace for Common Provenance Model RO-Crate model",
    "hasDefinedTerm": [
      { "@id": "https://w3id.org/cpm/ro-crate#CPMProvenanceFile" },
      { "@id": "https://w3id.org/cpm/ro-crate#CPMMetaProvenanceFile" }
    ]
  },
  { 
    "@id": "https://w3id.org/cpm/ro-crate#CPMProvenanceFile",
    "@type": "DefinedTerm",
    "…" : ""
  }
```


#### Extension terms

A profile that [extends RO-Crate](appendix/jsonld.md#extending-ro-crate) MAY indicate particular terms
directly as [DefinedTerm], [Class] and/or [Property] instances:

```json
{
    "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#runsOn",
    "@type": "DefinedTerm",
    "termCode": "runsOn",
    "name": "Runs on",
    "description": "Service where the test instance is executed",
    "url": "https://lifemonitor.eu/workflow_testing_ro_crate#test-instance"
}
```

The `termCode` SHOULD be valid as a key in JSON-LD `@context` of conforming RO-Crates. The term SHOULD be mapped to the terms' `@id` in the `@context` of this Profile Crate.



#### JSON-LD Context

A profile that have a corresponding JSON-LD `@context` (e.g. to map its extensions terms,
or to suggest a version of RO-Crate's official context) SHOULD indicate the 
context in the Profile Crate:

```json
{
    "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT/context",
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name": "RO-Crate JSON-LD Context",
    "encodingFormat": "application/ld+json",
    "conformsTo": {"@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#Context"},
    "version": "1.1.1"
},
{
    "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#Context",
    "@type": "DefinedTerm",
    "name": "JSON-LD Context",
    "url": "https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/"
}
```

The JSON-LD Context entity:

* MUST have an `encodingFormat` of `application/ld+json`
* MUST have an absolute URI as `@id`, which MUST be retrievable as JSON-LD directly or with content-negotiation and/or HTTP redirects.
* SHOULD have a _permalink_ (persistent identifier) as `@id`
  - e.g. starting with <https://w3id.org/> <http://purl.org/>
  - MAY embed major.minor version in the PID, e.g. <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2/context>
* SHOULD use `https` rather than `http` with a certificate commonly accepted by browsers
* SHOULD have a `@id` URI that is _versioned_ with [`MAJOR.MINOR`][semver], e.g. `https://example.com/image-profile-2.4`
* SHOULD have a descriptive [name]
* SHOULD have a `encodingFormat` to the contextual entity `http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#Context`
* MAY declare [version] according to [Semantic Versioning][semver]
- Updates MAY add new terms or patch fixes (with corresponding `version` change)
* Updates SHOULD NOT remove terms already published and potentially used by consumers of the profile
* Updates SHOULD NOT replace URIs terms map to -- except for typos.

Note that the referenced context URI does _not_ have to match the `@context` of the Profile Crate itself.

{: .tip }
The `@context` MAY be the Profile Crate's Metadata JSON-LD file if 
it is [resolvable](appendix/jsonld.md#ro-crate-json-ld-media-type)
as media type `application/ld+json` over HTTP. Make sure the crate includes the 
defined terms both within its `@context` and ideally as entities in its `@graph`.
